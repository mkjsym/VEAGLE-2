In 1980, Australia relied heavily on coal for electricity production, with 60% of the units coming from this source. In contrast, France had a more diverse fuel mix, with 30% of the units coming from coal, 20% from nuclear, and 10% from oil.\n\nIn 2000, the situation had changed significantly. Australia's reliance on coal had decreased to 40%, while nuclear power had increased to 30%. Oil and hydro power had also become more prominent sources of electricity production. On the other hand, France's reliance on nuclear power had increased to 50%, while coal and oil had decreased.\n\nComparing the two countries, it is evident that France has been more successful in diversifying its fuel mix, with a higher reliance on nuclear power. In contrast, Australia has seen a decrease in coal production and an increase in hydro power, which could be attributed to the country's abundant water resources.
